### Pilotcase Amilu

Amilu is a family-owned company with a vision to develop a small, real-time GPS tracker that leverages either LoRa (Long Range) or NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) technologies. 
This device needs to be as small as possible, and aims to integrate seamlessly into an ecosystem of other security-related devices, providing enhanced tracking and location services. 
Due to confidentiality agreements and the sensitive nature of the project, further details remain undisclosed.

### Building a Real-Time GPS Tracker with NB-IoT

Creating a real-time GPS tracker with NB-IoT and an accelerometer, as compact as a coin, requires specialized equipment. Initially, we need to develop a prototype using development boards.

The main requirements for the device are:
* Wireless charging via a docking station
* Activation upon being lifted from the docking station (utilizing the accelerometer)
* Transmission of GPS coordinates every 10 to 60 seconds
* Battery life exceeding 12 hours

#### What is a GPS Tracker and what is NB-IoT?

1. **GPS Tracker**: This is an electronic device that uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine and continuously report its precise location. By triangulating signals from at least four satellites, the device can calculate its position in terms of latitude and longitude. The GPS data is used for various purposes, such as navigation, asset tracking, or personal safety.

2. **NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)**: NB-IoT is a low-power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology that facilitates communication between devices and the internet, especially for applications that transmit small amounts of data infrequently. It is designed to provide coverage over long distances and through physical obstructions, using minimal power.

3. **Accelerometer**: An accelerometer is a device that measures acceleration forces. In GPS trackers, it is used to detect movement and stillness, which can contribute to energy efficiency by only activating GPS and data transmission when movement is detected.


 **Components**:
   - **GPS Module**: This component is responsible for obtaining positional data. Modern GPS modules can be very compact and offer high precision.
   - **NB-IoT Module**: Choose a module that best fits the coverage and power requirements of your application.
   (Note: GPS + GNSS module below includs both NB-IoT and GPS)
   - **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**: This acts as the brain of the device, responsible for processing data from the GPS module, handling communication with the NB-IoT module, and processing signals from the accelerometer.
   - **Accelerometer**: This component adds motion detection, which can be used to control when the device should enter low-power mode or activate GPS tracking.
   - **Battery**: Choose a battery that can provide sufficient power for the expected lifetime of the device, often aiming to operate for months or even years on a single charge.
